# Project Roadmap: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

This document outlines the planned timeline and milestones for fine-tuning the Flux.1 Dev model for Impressionist style transfer.

## Phase 1: Research & Preparation (Week 1-2)

### Week 1: Research & Planning
- [x] Review literature on artistic style transfer techniques
  - Identified LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as primary fine-tuning approach
  - LoRA advantages: faster training, lower memory requirements (~11GB GPU RAM)
  - Recent improvements: Block-wise LoRA for better style preservation
- [x] Research key characteristics of Impressionist painting style
  - Visible, short brush strokes using broken color technique
  - Emphasis on light and its changing qualities
  - Use of pure, unmixed colors side by side
  - Avoidance of black, using complementary colors for shadows
  - Focus on overall visual effects rather than details
  - Capture of momentary and transient effects
  - Natural, candid scenes and compositions
- [x] Explore efficient fine-tuning approaches for diffusion models
  - LoRA identified as optimal approach for style transfer
  - Training requires ~3MB for weight storage
  - Compatible with consumer GPUs (11GB+ VRAM)
  - Higher learning rates possible (1e-4 vs 1e-6 for full fine-tuning)
- [x] Research Flux.1 Dev model capabilities
  - Model Architecture:
    - 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer
    - Multimodal and parallel diffusion transformer blocks
    - Base resolution of 1024x1024 with flexible aspect ratios
    - Advanced T5 text encoder for better prompt alignment
  - Fine-tuning Requirements:
    - Minimum: NVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM)
    - Recommended: NVIDIA RTX 3090 or better
    - System RAM: ~50GB for model quantization
    - Training time: 1.5-4.5 hours depending on dataset
  - LoRA Training Options:
    - Various quantization levels available:
      - int8 + bf16: ~18GB VRAM
      - int4 + bf16: ~13GB VRAM
      - NF4/int2 + bf16: ~9GB VRAM
    - Supports rank-16 LoRA for all components
    - Compatible with Dreambooth training approach
- [x] Plan project structure and workflow
  - Project Structure:
