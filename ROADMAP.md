- [ ] Research key characteristics of Impressionist painting style
- [ ] Explore efficient fine-tuning approaches for diffusion models
- [ ] Benchmark existing style transfer methods
- [ ] Plan project structure and workflow

### Week 2: Environment & Data Setup
- [ ] Configure Google Colab development environment
- [ ] Set up connection to Hugging Face Hub
- [ ] Access and explore WikiArt Impressionism dataset
- [ ] Analyze dataset quality and characteristics
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing pipeline

## Phase 2: Model Development & Fine-Tuning (Week 3-4)

### Week 3: Initial Model Development
- [ ] Set up base Flux.1 Dev model
- [ ] Implement LoRA fine-tuning approach
- [ ] Develop training script with logging and checkpointing
