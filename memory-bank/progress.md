# Progress: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Status
Project is in the **initial planning phase**. We have established:
- Project goals and requirements documented
- Initial repository created on GitHub
- Memory Bank documentation initialized

## What Works
- Project documentation structure is in place
- GitHub repository has been created
- Core project requirements and technical approach defined

## What's Left to Build
1. **Research & Planning**:
   - [ ] Literature review of artistic style transfer techniques
   - [ ] Analysis of Impressionist style characteristics
   - [ ] Exploration of fine-tuning approaches for diffusion models
   - [ ] Benchmark of existing style transfer methods

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - [ ] Google Colab development environment
   - [ ] Hugging Face Hub connection and authentication
   - [ ] Training infrastructure setup
   - [ ] Evaluation pipeline

3. **Data Pipeline**:
   - [ ] WikiArt dataset access and download
   - [ ] Data preprocessing scripts
   - [ ] Data filtering for quality control
   - [ ] Data augmentation implementation
   - [ ] Dataset statistics and visualization

4. **Model Development**:
   - [ ] Base model integration
   - [ ] Fine-tuning script development
   - [ ] Hyperparameter optimization
   - [ ] Training loop implementation
   - [ ] Checkpoint management system

5. **Evaluation System**:
   - [ ] Objective metrics implementation
   - [ ] Subjective evaluation framework
   - [ ] Comparative analysis scripts
   - [ ] Sample generation pipeline

6. **Deployment**:
   - [ ] Model export and optimization
   - [ ] Hugging Face Hub model upload
   - [ ] Hugging Face Spaces demo application
   - [ ] Documentation for users

7. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Technical methodology documentation
   - [ ] Training process documentation
   - [ ] Results analysis and showcase
   - [ ] User guide for the deployed model

## Known Issues
- Need to research the most efficient fine-tuning technique for Flux.1 Dev
- WikiArt dataset access and licensing requirements to be confirmed
- Google Colab runtime limitations may impact training process
- Balance between fine-tuning depth and overfitting to be managed
- Evaluation metrics for artistic quality are subjective and challenging to quantify
