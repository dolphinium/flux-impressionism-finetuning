# Progress: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Status
Project has completed initial research phase and project structure planning. Key findings and decisions:

### Fine-tuning Approach
- Selected LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as primary fine-tuning method
- Benefits include:
  - Fast training times
  - Low memory requirements (~11GB GPU RAM)
  - Small weight storage (~3MB)
  - Compatible with consumer GPUs
  - Higher learning rates possible (1e-4)
- Recent Block-wise LoRA improvements for better style preservation

### Base Model Analysis: Flux.1 Dev
- Architecture Strengths:
  - 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer
  - Advanced T5 text encoder for better prompt alignment
  - Flexible aspect ratio support (base: 1024x1024)
  - Multimodal and parallel diffusion blocks
- Hardware Requirements:
  - Minimum: NVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM)
  - Recommended: NVIDIA RTX 3090 or better
  - System RAM: ~50GB for model quantization
- LoRA Training Options:
  - Multiple quantization levels:
    - int8 + bf16: ~18GB VRAM
    - int4 + bf16: ~13GB VRAM
    - NF4/int2 + bf16: ~9GB VRAM
  - Supports rank-16 LoRA for all components
  - Compatible with Dreambooth approach
  - Training time: 1.5-4.5 hours per dataset

### Impressionist Style Characteristics
Identified key features to capture in fine-tuning:
- Visible, short brush strokes using broken color technique
- Emphasis on light and its changing qualities
- Use of pure, unmixed colors side by side
- Avoidance of black, using complementary colors for shadows
- Focus on overall visual effects rather than details
- Capture of momentary and transient effects
- Natural, candid scenes and compositions

### Project Structure and Workflow
- Defined modular project structure with clear separation of concerns
- Established development workflow using Google Colab and local environment
- Planned training pipeline with monitoring and evaluation systems
- Set up deployment strategy using Hugging Face ecosystem
