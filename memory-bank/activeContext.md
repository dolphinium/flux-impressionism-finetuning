# Active Context: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Work Focus
We have completed the dataset preparation phase and successfully uploaded the curated dataset to Hugging Face Hub. The focus is now shifting to:

1. Setting up the training pipeline
2. Implementing model fine-tuning infrastructure
3. Developing evaluation metrics
4. Preparing monitoring systems

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Completed dataset curation pipeline
- ✅ Successfully processed and validated 1,000 images
- ✅ Uploaded dataset to Hugging Face Hub
- ✅ Created comprehensive dataset documentation
- ✅ Updated project documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Training Setup**:
   - Configure model loading and initialization
   - Set up LoRA adaptation layers
   - Implement training loop
   - Configure checkpointing

2. **Evaluation System**:
   - Define quantitative metrics
   - Set up qualitative evaluation pipeline
   - Create visualization tools
   - Implement comparison framework

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Training Configuration**: 
   - Need to determine optimal LoRA rank
   - Need to set appropriate learning rates
   - Need to define batch sizes and gradient accumulation
   - Need to establish training schedule

2. **Resource Management**: 
   - Plan for efficient GPU utilization
   - Set up checkpointing strategy
   - Configure memory optimization
   - Implement gradient checkpointing if needed

3. **Quality Monitoring**:
   - Define evaluation frequency
   - Set up progress tracking
   - Implement sample generation pipeline
   - Create visualization dashboard

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Document training procedures
   - Create evaluation guidelines
   - Prepare model cards
   - Update progress tracking
