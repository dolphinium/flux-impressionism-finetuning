# Active Context: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Work Focus
We have completed the dataset preparation phase with an efficient processing pipeline. The focus has been on:

1. Creating an efficient dataset curation system
2. Implementing quality-based filtering
3. Setting up Hugging Face Hub integration
4. Optimizing for Google Colab environment

## Recent Changes
- Implemented DatasetCurator class for efficient processing
- Created streaming data handling system
- Set up quality validation pipeline
- Implemented genre-based filtering
- Added Hugging Face Hub integration
- Optimized for high-RAM Colab environment

## Next Steps
1. **Dataset Processing**:
   - Run the curation pipeline
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Validate selected images
   - Upload to Hugging Face Hub

2. **Training Preparation**:
   - Set up training pipeline components
   - Configure model checkpointing
   - Implement training monitoring
   - Prepare evaluation metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Resource Management**: 
   - Using high-RAM Colab runtime
   - Implementing streaming processing
   - Efficient caching strategy
2. **Quality Control**: 
   - Minimum 512px dimension
   - Maximum 2:1 aspect ratio
   - File size quality threshold
3. **Dataset Balance**:
   - 30% landscapes
   - 30% portraits
   - 20% urban scenes
   - 20% still life/nature
4. **Processing Efficiency**:
   - Streaming data loading
   - Batch processing
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling
