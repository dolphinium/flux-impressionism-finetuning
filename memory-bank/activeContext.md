# Active Context: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Work Focus
We are currently in the initial planning and setup phase of the project. The focus is on:

1. Establishing project requirements and goals
2. Creating comprehensive documentation for the project roadmap
3. Researching optimal fine-tuning approaches for artistic style transfer
4. Setting up the development environment and infrastructure

## Recent Changes
- Created GitHub repository for the project
- Initialized Memory Bank documentation
- Defined system architecture and technical approach
- Established technical requirements and dependencies

## Next Steps
1. **Research & Planning**:
   - Conduct detailed review of artistic style transfer literature
   - Research specific characteristics of Impressionist painting style
   - Explore efficient fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models
   - Investigate LoRA and other parameter-efficient methods

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Configure Google Colab environment for development
   - Set up connection to Hugging Face Hub
   - Prepare repository structure for code organization
   - Create initial notebook templates

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Access and download WikiArt Impressionism dataset
   - Explore data characteristics and quality
   - Design preprocessing pipeline for the dataset
   - Plan data filtering and augmentation strategies

4. **Model Exploration**:
   - Analyze Flux.1 Dev model architecture and capabilities
   - Understand the model's strengths and limitations
   - Identify optimal fine-tuning approach for the model
   - Determine evaluation metrics for the fine-tuned model

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Deciding between full fine-tuning vs. LoRA/adapter-based methods
2. **Dataset Quality**: Assessing the quality and diversity of the Impressionism dataset
3. **Training Efficiency**: Balancing training time vs. quality of results
4. **Evaluation Approach**: Determining objective and subjective evaluation metrics
5. **Deployment Considerations**: Planning for efficient model serving on HF Spaces
