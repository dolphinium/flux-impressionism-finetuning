# Active Context: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Work Focus
We are currently in the dataset optimization phase of the project. The focus is on:

1. Creating a curated, high-quality dataset
2. Implementing efficient data loading and processing
3. Preparing for dataset publication on Hugging Face
4. Setting up training infrastructure

## Recent Changes
- Developed curated dataset strategy with balanced composition
- Implemented quality-based filtering criteria
- Created dataset publishing workflow
- Optimized data processing pipeline

## Next Steps
1. **Dataset Publication**:
   - Test curated dataset creation
   - Validate selection criteria
   - Publish to Hugging Face Hub
   - Document dataset characteristics

2. **Training Preparation**:
   - Set up training pipeline components
   - Configure model checkpointing
   - Implement training monitoring
   - Prepare evaluation metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Dataset Optimization**: Balancing quality vs. quantity
2. **Selection Criteria**: Ensuring representative sample selection
3. **Processing Efficiency**: Optimizing data loading and preprocessing
4. **Quality Control**: Maintaining high standards for training data
5. **Community Contribution**: Preparing valuable dataset for public use
