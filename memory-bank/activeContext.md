# Active Context: Flux Impressionism Fine-Tuning

## Current Work Focus
We have completed the image captioning pipeline and are preparing for the next fine-tuning iteration. The focus is now on:

1. Analyzing caption quality and coverage
2. Preparing for fine-tuning with enhanced captions
3. Developing custom training pipeline
4. Implementing evaluation metrics

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Completed image captioning pipeline with Gemini API
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling and retry system
- ✅ Added checkpoint and logging mechanisms
- ✅ Integrated with HuggingFace datasets
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Caption Analysis**:
   - Review generated captions for quality
   - Validate genre-specific descriptions
   - Assess coverage and completeness
   - Identify areas for improvement

2. **Fine-tuning Preparation**:
   - Update training dataset with new captions
   - Configure training parameters
   - Set up evaluation metrics
   - Prepare monitoring system

3. **Custom Pipeline Development**:
   - Design architecture for custom training
   - Implement monitoring and visualization
   - Add advanced hyperparameter control
   - Create evaluation framework

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Caption Generation**: 
   - Using Gemini API with genre-aware prompting
   - Multiple API keys for rate limit management
   - Batch processing with checkpoints
   - Automatic retry for failed captions

2. **Data Management**: 
   - JSON-based intermediate storage
   - Checkpoint system for reliability
   - Progress tracking and logging
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Next Training Phase**:
   - Evaluate caption impact on training
   - Consider trigger word implementation
   - Plan for extended training duration
   - Design evaluation metrics

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Document captioning pipeline
   - Update training procedures
   - Maintain progress tracking
   - Record best practices
