# Project Brief: Fine-Tuning Flux.1 Dev for Impressionist Style Transfer

## Project Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning the Flux.1 Dev generative AI model to create images in the style of Impressionist paintings. By leveraging the WikiArt dataset's Impressionism subset, we aim to develop a specialized model capable of generating high-quality artistic images that embody the distinctive qualities of Impressionist art.

## Core Objectives
- Fine-tune Flux.1 Dev model to faithfully reproduce Impressionist painting styles
- Create a deployable model that generates consistent and high-quality Impressionist-style images
- Document the fine-tuning process comprehensively for educational purposes
- Showcase the effectiveness of the fine-tuning through comparative examples

## Technical Requirements
- Utilize Google Colab Pro for GPU-accelerated training
- Implement fine-tuning using Hugging Face's diffusers library
- Host the fine-tuned model on Hugging Face Hub
- Deploy a user-friendly demo on HF Spaces with GPU support
- Maintain comprehensive documentation in GitHub repository

## Success Criteria
- Model consistently produces images with recognizable Impressionist characteristics
- Clear visual improvement in style transfer compared to base model
- Comprehensive documentation of methodology and results
- Functional deployed demo on HF Spaces
- Well-organized GitHub repository with complete documentation
