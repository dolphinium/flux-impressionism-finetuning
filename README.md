## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes the Flux.1 Dev model to generate images in the style of Impressionist paintings. By training on the WikiArt dataset's Impressionism subset, we create a specialized model that captures the distinctive aesthetic qualities of Impressionist art while maintaining the flexibility of a general text-to-image model.

## Features

- Fine-tuned Flux.1 Dev model specialized in Impressionist styles
- Interactive demo on Hugging Face Spaces
- Comprehensive documentation of the fine-tuning process
- Visual showcase demonstrating the model's capabilities
- Reusable code for similar fine-tuning projects

## Dataset

I've created a carefully curated subset of the WikiArt dataset, specifically focused on Impressionist paintings. The dataset is available on Hugging Face Hub:

🤗 [wikiart-impressionism-curated](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dolphinium/wikiart-impressionism-curated)

### Dataset Features
- 1,000 high-quality Impressionist paintings
- Balanced genre distribution:
  - Landscapes (30%)
  - Portraits (30%)
  - Urban Scenes (20%)
  - Still Life (20%)
- Quality criteria:
  - Minimum dimension: 512px
  - Maximum aspect ratio: 2:1
  - Quality-controlled file sizes
  - Verified Impressionist style

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- Hugging Face account (free or Pro)
- Google Colab Pro (for training with GPU)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dolphinium/flux-impressionism-finetuning.git
cd flux-impressionism-finetuning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development Process

This project follows a structured approach to fine-tuning:

1. **Research & Planning**: Understanding Impressionist style and fine-tuning techniques
2. **Data Preparation**: Processing the WikiArt Impressionism dataset
3. **Model Development**: Fine-tuning Flux.1 Dev with optimized parameters
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing quality through objective and subjective metrics
5. **Deployment**: Making the model accessible through Hugging Face

For detailed timeline, see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Model Usage

Once deployed, you can use the model in two ways:

### Via Hugging Face Hub

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("dolphinium/flux-impressionism-v1")
image = pipeline("A landscape with trees by a river").images[0]
image.save("impressionist_landscape.png")
```

### Via Interactive Demo

Visit our [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dolphinium/flux-impressionism-demo) for an interactive demo.
